# The 'env' section below is commented out to resolve a build error.
# This error occurs when the secrets (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY)
# are not found in your Google Cloud project's Secret Manager.
#
# TO FIX PROPERLY:
# 1. Create the secrets in Secret Manager.
# 2. Grant the App Hosting service account access to them.
# 3. Uncomment the 'env' block below.
#
# For now, the build will proceed, but you must provide credentials via a .env file
# for the deployed app to function. See .env.template for details.

# env:
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
#     secret: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
#     availability: ["BUILD", "RUNTIME"]
#   - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
